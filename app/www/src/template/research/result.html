            <p>We made <strong>Jobayan.com</strong> as an alternative channel for technology based companies, startups,
                and overall, non-corporate companies like our own, to simply and quickly find fresh and savvy talent.
                We took a deep look on how our sister companies

                <a href="https://acesjobs.com.ph/" title="Aces Call Center Jobs" target="_blank">Aces Call Center Jobs</a>
                acquire talent as well as other similar industries, tech, and startups alike. We have been collecting data
                on the hiring process for over a year and wanted to translate our findings through this website.</p>
            <br/>
